Notes on PracticePython#3: less than 10

Takes a list of names of paper mario characters and
prints out the names of all all characters with 5
letters in the name or less.

This version is an extra and will print them all at once."""

list_of_names = ["mario", "luigi", "defender", "galaga", "blow dryer", "punjabi", "peach", "tippi", "yoshi", "pennington", "mii", "mg", "wii"]

for i in list_of_names:
    if len(i) < 5:
        #instead of printing here, you append i to the list five_or_less


#whatever statement you have here will run once the for loop is finished.
#you will print the list five_or_less
