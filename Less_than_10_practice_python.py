Takes a list of names of paper mario characters and
prints out the names of all all characters with 5
letters in the name or less"""
#what are the steps of this program
#create a list of character names
list_of_names = ["mario", "luigi", "peach"]
#sort through the list.  You will need to use
#   the for loop here.  Also length of name is len(name)
#   find out if len(name) are bigger or less than 5
#Print the len(name) less than 5
print(list_of_names)

#the for statement below goes through every item of
#the list 'list_of_names'
for i in list_of_names:
    #add a statement here about checking len(name)
    print len(i)

#my_list = [str("mario]

#for i in my_list:
#    print(i)
